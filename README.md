This is a CL-SAT binding to [PicoSAT](http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/),
a SAT solver which frequently appear in the SATRace competition.
It is somehow advertized as "faster than minisat 2.0 in industrial track", according to the Ubuntu package description,
and has many bindings in other languages.
However, the most recent competition winners are Glucose/Lingeling, so we rather recommend cl-sat.glucose.
